How do I save a file in other directory in vim?
You must type the full path to the location where you want to save 
the file with the write command. For instance, save file in :
/Users/User/Documents/dev++ saved file/VIM

Current Working Directory:
:pwd

Changing directory (cd command):
:cd /Users/User/Documents/dev++ saved file/VIM

change back to the previous working directory:
:cd -

Suppose you are currently in the /usr/local/share directory, 
to switch to the /usr/local directory (one level up from the 
current directory), you would type:
:cd ../

Listing directory contents:
:ls

display all files including the hidden files:
:ls -a ~/

opening file from current directory:
:e filename3.c++

paste from other browser or program:
i 
shift then insert

tab example:
gt

move selection line up down:
c-j = ctrl + down
c-k = ctrl + up

undo and redo:
u = undo
ctrl + r = redo
